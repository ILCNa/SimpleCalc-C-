一款简单但比较完善的计算器.
C# winform:

1.用panel重写了标题栏.

2.对计算操作进行了相当多的优化(凡是我能想到的).

3.具有历史记录功能,区分了C与CE.

4.可以进行简单的四则运算,以及幂运算.

5.一些贴心优化.

作者用不惯微软自带的计算器,故借鉴其风格写了该计算器.用来处理日常生活中简单的计算需求.

--------------------------------------------------
C# WinForms:

Custom Title Bar: Redesigned the title bar using a panel.

Optimized Calculations: Numerous optimizations implemented for various calculation operations (as many as I could think of).

History Tracking: Includes a history tracking feature, distinguishing between 'C' and 'CE'.

Basic Arithmetic and Power Operations: Supports simple arithmetic operations and exponentiation.

User-Friendly Enhancements: Several thoughtful optimizations for a better user experience.

The author found the default Microsoft calculator uncomfortable to use, hence drew inspiration from its style to create this calculator. Designed to handle everyday simple calculation needs in daily life.
